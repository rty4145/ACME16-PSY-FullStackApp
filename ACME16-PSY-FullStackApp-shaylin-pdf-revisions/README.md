## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

The project focuses on the enhancement and integration of two PICA applications: a Qualtrics-based web survey for personalized personality assessment feedback and a mobile self-monitoring app where participants log emotional events.

### Additional information about the project
This project extends the work of a previous capstone team and aims to improve both the Qualtrics-based survey report and the mobile app for tracking emotional experiences. Key improvements include enabling the generation and emailing of PDF personality reports, incorporating advanced data visualizations, and refining the app’s feedback functionality with more sophisticated clustering algorithms. These applications will support mental health treatment by offering personalized feedback and logging emotional responses to daily events, contributing to Belinda Lin’s dissertation funding application.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Git
Python (version 3.x)
pip (Python package installer)


### Add-ons
Flask
python anywhere
MongoDB
Email Libraries

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 


## Functionality

The project includes two main components:
Qualtrics web-based survey: Users complete the survey and then generate a personalized PDF report summarizing their personality assessment. The report is automatically emailed to the user and their clinician. The report can be viewed directly on the web app or downloaded as a PDF.
Mobile self-monitoring app:
Users log daily emotional events, including both positive and negative experiences.
The app will soon include AI-driven clustering algorithms to suggest “functionally equivalent” situations based on user input.


## Known Problems
Some users reported issues with automatic emailing of the PDF reports. 
Currently, the web survey and mobile app are not fully integrated, and data has to be entered manually.
