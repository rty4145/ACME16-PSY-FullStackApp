1. Agenda
	- Introduce ourselves to the client
	- Get an overview of the project and get more details about the project description and requirements
	
2. Meeeting Summary
	Introduction:
		- This project is broken up into two different surveys. One collects the thoughts and emotions of the person during daily activities and contexts. The other is a larger survey that asks questions to the user and then sends them a PDF to their email that details information about their temperment.
	Client's Requirements:
		- The client would like the PDF file to be correctly sent to the user's email. At the moment this functionality does not work.
		- The client would like both surveys to be integrated together so that the daily survey asks the user questions based upon their temperment results.
		- The client would like a better grouping system that groups different events and contexts together based upon how similarly the user felt during them.
