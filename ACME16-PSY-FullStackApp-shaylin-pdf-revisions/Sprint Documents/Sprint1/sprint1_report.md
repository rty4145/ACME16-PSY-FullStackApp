## What's New (User Facing)
 * Meeting Minutes
 * Project Documents: Project Description, Requirements and Specifications, Team Inventory
 * Skills Training Progress
 
## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, my team and I established contact with our client, the WSU Psychology Clinic and went over the project we will be working on. Before our first meeting with the client, we sent a a team inventory to introduce ourselves and let the client know more about our skillsets. We then had our first meeting with the client and talked about the research being done into the personality based assesment to help patients. We then asked for more details into the expectations towards the two applications we will be working on. We then wrote the Background and Related Work, Project Overview, and Client and Stakeholder Information for our week one documentation. For week two, we had to create our use case diagram as well as functional and non-functional requirement. This led to some challenges as we had to revisit how to set up use case diagrams and revisit with our client about their expectations for use cases. For our third week, we started on our research and learning more about full stack development. We started some LLM courses hosted by deeplearning.ai as well as a MongoDB course hosted on codeacademy to familiarize ourselves with the technology set up by the previous group.

## Unfinished Work
https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/6
Progress: We have successfully run the web software locally from the previous team, but the automatic email functionality is still incomplete. We have made progress on connecting the PDF generator to our email system.
Reason: This task is taking more time than expected due to additional technical challenges with email server configuration.
Plan: We are moving this task to Sprint 2, where we plan to complete the remaining email functionality.

https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/19
Progress: Watching the "Learn MongoDB" course offered by Codeacademy.
Reason: Due to the complexity of the MongoDB course, we underestimated the time required to learn.
Plan: We will continue the course in Sprint 2.

https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/18
Progress: Watching the “Pre-trained LLM” course from deeplearning.ai.
Plan: We will continue the course in Sprint 2.

https://github.com/plasmaaShark/ACME16-PSY-FullStackApp/issues/17
Progress: Watching the “Open Source Models with Hugging Face” course from deeplearning.ai
Plan: We will continue the course in Sprint 2.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
Most of the issues in this sprint were documentation, and GitHub does not support merging documents. For issues related to our own documentation work, there will be no pull requests in most cases. Instead, when the documentation work is completed, everyone will upload their own documents to GitHub, and the team leader will integrate and submit them.
